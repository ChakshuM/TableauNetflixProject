# TableauNetflixProject

**Project Scope:**
Utilized Tableau to create a project centered around Netflix, drawing insights from data sourced from Kaggle. This project involved several key steps, each contributing to a comprehensive analysis and visualization of Netflix-related trends and patterns.

**Data Acquisition:**
Sourced the data for this project from Kaggle, such as titles, genres, release dates, viewer ratings, and more. This data served as the foundation for my Tableau project.

**Data Preparation:**
Performed all the data preparation activies in the Power BI transformation tab in order to deal with any inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information. 

**Analysis and Visualization:**
Created various visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and geographical maps, to explore different aspects of Netflix's content catalog, audience preferences, regional trends, and more. These visualizations helped uncover insights and trends that might not have been immediately apparent from the raw data alone.

**Storytelling and Presentation:**
Structured the visualizations and analysis into a coherent storyline that flowed logically from one point to the next.

**Outcome**
